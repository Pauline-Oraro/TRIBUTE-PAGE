            <h2>HER CHILDHOOD</h2>
            <P>
                Mother Teresa was born <em>Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu</em> in Skopje, Macedonia, on <strong>August 26, 1910.</strong> Her family was of Albanian descent. At the age of twelve, she felt strongly the call of God. She knew she had to be a missionary to spread the love of Christ. At the age of eighteen she left her parental home in Skopje and joined the Sisters of Loreto, an Irish community of nuns with missions in India. After a few months of training in Dublin she was sent to India, where on<strong> May 24, 1931,</strong> she took her initial vows as a nun.

                <h2>THE COVENANT</h2><p>
        <strong>From 1931 to 1948</strong> Mother Teresa taught at St. Mary's High School in Calcutta, but the suffering and poverty she glimpsed outside the convent walls made such a deep impression on her that in<strong> 1948</strong> she received permission from her superiors to leave the convent school and devote herself to working among the poorest of the poor in the slums of Calcutta. Although she had no funds, she depended on Divine Providence, and started an open-air school for slum children. Soon she was joined by voluntary helpers, and financial support was also forthcoming. This made it possible for her to extend the scope of her work.

                    <h2>HER WORK</h2>
                    <P>
        On <strong>October 7, 1950,</strong> Mother Teresa received permission from the Holy See to start her own order, “The Missionaries of Charity”, whose primary task was to love and care for those persons nobody was prepared to look after. In <strong>1965</strong> the Society became an International Religious Family by a decree of Pope Paul VI.

        <P>Today the order comprises Active and Contemplative branches of Sisters and Brothers in many countries. In <strong>1963</strong> both the Contemplative branch of the Sisters and the Active branch of the Brothers was founded. In 1979 the Contemplative branch of the Brothers was added, and in 1984 the Priest branch was established.</P></section>
